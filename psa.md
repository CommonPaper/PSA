Each SOW together with the Key Terms and Standard Terms will constitute a separate agreement. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> will comply with <span class="keyterms_link">Customer Policies</span>, if any.

11. <span class="header_2">Confidentiality</span>
    1. <span class="header_3">Non-Use and Non-Disclosure.</span>  Unless otherwise authorized in the Agreement, Recipient will (a) only use Discloser’s Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement; and (b) not disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to anyone else. In addition, Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information using at least the same protections Recipient uses for its own similar information but no less than a reasonable standard of care.
    2. <span class="header_3">Exclusions.</span>  Confidential Information does not include information that (a) Recipient knew without any obligation of confidentiality before disclosure by Discloser; (b) is or becomes publicly known and generally available through no fault of Recipient; (c) Recipient receives under no obligation of confidentiality from someone else who is authorized to make the disclosure; or (d) Recipient independently developed without use of or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information.
    3. <span class="header_3">Required Disclosures.</span>  Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to the extent required by Applicable Laws if, unless prohibited by Applicable Laws, Recipient provides the Disclosing Party reasonable advance notice of the required disclosure and reasonably cooperates, at the Discloser’s expense, with the Discloser’s efforts to obtain confidential treatment for the Confidential Information.
    4. <span class="header_3">Permitted Disclosures.</span>  Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to employees, advisors, contractors, and representatives who each have a need to know the Confidential Information, but only if the person or entity is bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in this Section 11 and Recipient remains responsible for everyone’s compliance with the terms of this Section 11.
12. <span class="header_2">General Terms</span>
    1. <span class="header_3">Entire Agreement.</span>  This Agreement is the only agreement between the parties about its subject and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous statements (whether in writing or not) about its subject. <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> expressly rejects any terms included in <span class="keyterms_link">Customer's</span> purchase order or similar document, which may only be used for accounting or administrative purposes.
    2. <span class="header_3">Modifications, Severability, and Waiver.</span>  Any waiver, modification, or change to the Agreement must be in writing and signed or electronically accepted by each party. However, this does not limit <span class="keyterms_link">Provider's</span> or <span class="keyterms_link">Customer's</span> ability to update an SOW by following the Change Order procedures. If any term of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a relevant court or governing body, the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The failure of a party to enforce a term or to exercise an option or right in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver by that party of the term, option, or right.
    3. <span class="header_3">Governing Law and Chosen Courts.</span>  The <span class="keyterms_link">Governing Law</span> will govern all interpretations and disputes about this Agreement, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The parties will bring any legal suit, action, or proceeding about this Agreement or an SOW in the <span class="keyterms_link">Chosen Courts</span> and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the <span class="keyterms_link">Chosen Courts</span>.
    4. <span class="header_3">Injunctive Relief.</span>  Despite Section 12.3 (Governing Law and Chosen Courts), a breach of Section 11 (Confidentiality) or the violation of a party’s intellectual property rights may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages cannot adequately compensate. As a result, upon the actual or threatened breach of Section 11 (Confidentiality) or violation of a party’s intellectual property rights, the non-breaching or non-violating party may seek appropriate equitable relief, including an injunction, in any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post a bond and without limiting its other rights or remedies.
    5. <span class="header_3">Non-Exhaustive Remedies.</span>  Except where the Agreement provides for an exclusive remedy, seeking or exercising a remedy does not limit the other rights or remedies available to a party.
    6. <span class="header_3">Assignment.</span>  Neither party may assign any rights or obligations under this Agreement or any SOW without the prior written consent of the other party. However, <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> may assign this Agreement upon notice if <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> undergoes a merger, change of control, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all its equity, business, or assets to which this Agreement relates. Any attempted but non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.
    7. <span class="header_3">No Publicity.</span>  Neither party may publicly announce the existence of this Agreement or any SOW without the prior written approval of the other party.
    8. <span class="header_3">Notices.</span>  Any notice, request, or approval about the Agreement must be in writing and sent to the Notice Address. Notices will be deemed given (a) upon confirmed delivery if by email, registered or certified mail, or personal delivery; or (b) two days after mailing if by overnight commercial delivery.
    9. <span class="header_3">Independent Contractors.</span>  The parties are independent contractors, not agents, partners, or joint venturers. Neither party is authorized to bind the other to any liability or obligation.
    10. <span class="header_3">No Third-Party Beneficiary.</span>  There are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.
    11. <span class="header_3">Force Majeure.</span>  Neither party will be liable for a delay or failure to perform its obligations of this Agreement if caused by a Force Majeure Event. However, this section does not excuse <span class="keyterms_link">Customer's</span> obligations to pay <span class="sow_link">Fees</span>.
    12. <span class="header_3">Export Controls.</span>  <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> may not remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of the Service, <span class="sow_link">Deliverables</span>, or any related technology or materials in violation of any restrictions, laws, or regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other United States or foreign agency or authority.  
    13. <span class="header_3">Anti-Bribery.</span>  Neither party will take any action that would be a violation of any Applicable Laws that prohibit the offering, giving, promising to offer or give, or receiving, directly or indirectly, money or anything of value to any third party to assist <span class="keyterms_link">Provider</span> or <span class="keyterms_link">Customer</span> in retaining or obtaining business. Examples of these kinds of laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.
    14. <span class="header_3">Titles and Interpretation.</span>  Section titles are for convenience and reference only. All uses of "including" and similar phrases are non-exhaustive and without limitation.
    15. <span class="header_3">Signature.</span>  This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, including by electronic copies or acceptance mechanism. Each copy will be deemed an original and all copies, when taken together, will be the same agreement.
13. <span class="header_2">Definitions</span>
